# Utilize Progressive Enhancements

In every application or web page, we should do our best to ensure that all important content and essential user actions are available without JavaScript.

There are many advantages to developing this way—a methodology called [Progressive Enhancements](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here/) (PE). In fact, there is absolutely no downside to following the PE methodology.

1.  Resilience — PE is more stable and reliable.
2.  Accessibility — PE improves accessibility, decreasing your risk of lawsuits.
3.  Reach and usability — PE allows your web page or web application to be used by more people.
4.  SEO — PE improves your search engine performance.
5.  Cost-effectiveness — PE is a [more cost-effective](http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/) approach to development.
6.  Faster — [PE performs faster](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/).
7.  Increased conversions — Faster performing web sites and applications with more reach and better usability will increase your conversion rates.
8.  Future-proof and backward compatibility — Applications and web content written in HTML will always work well into the future (as browser technology changes) as well as work on any device.

We recognize that Progressive Enhancements isn’t always possible (especially on long-standing systems), and that we have many applications that have already been written to function exclusively with JavaScript. We should, however, be making every effort to move toward a more user-inclusive and more stable development model (i.e. Progressive Enhancements).
