# HTML is naturally accessible

When used properly, HTML is completely accessible by nature. Developers must make every effort to avoid making it inaccessible. When HTML is written in a non-semantic way or when an element is used in place of a more appropriate element (like a `<span>` for a button) the web page or application begins to be unusable.

## Takeaways

- HTML is accessible by default. Avoid making it inaccessible.
- Never use tables for layout.
- Tables should be marked up properly (like scope, IDs, headers attributes, etc.). In addition, [tables must only be used for tabular data only](https://medium.com/@heyoka/lets-bring-table-to-the-table-again-f1ae751159d5).
