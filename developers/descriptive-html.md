# HTML is descriptive

When writing HTML, try to use the appropriate HTML elements that most accurately represent the content. Be as semantic as possible. Consider what the content means (i.e. describes) rather than what it looks like or what you want it to look like.  HTML should never be used for presentation only meaning and structure. CSS should be used for presentation.

In the same way, information groupings must also be well-thought-out in order to convey meaning. This includes data representations.

*Ask yourself, "what is this content?"*

If itâ€™s a list, use a list, and choose an ordered list if order matters to the context.

## Takeaways

-   Meaning instead convenience.
-   Consider what the content means.
-  Avoid simply using `<div>` and `<span>` out of convenience. Save them for when there's no better option.
-  Try to use the HTML elements that most accurately represent the content.
-  Separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS).
-   Never use HTML for visual purposes, like using `<br>` for spacing.
-   Use appropriate heading levels (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) based on document order and structure, not what you want it to look like (i.e. size preference).
	- Nest headings properly.
-   Do not type in ALL CAPS unless it is an abbreviation or acronym.
